# LLMRL
This is a demo implementation for ICRA 2025 paper Goal-Guided Reinforcement Learning: Leverging Large Language Models for Long-Horizon Task Decomposition. LLMRL utilizes LLMs to decompose complex long-horizon tasks into subgoals and generate policies to provide guidence for goal-based exploration and training speedup.

**The task environment is based on [TWOSOME](https://github.com/WeihaoTan/TWOSOME) and [ROMAN](https://github.com/etriantafyllidis/ROMAN), the vanilla PPO implementation is based on [PPO-Pytorch](https://github.com/nikhilbarhate99/PPO-PyTorch) for which we modified to fit the proposed framework.
